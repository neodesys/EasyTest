Key Features
------------

- lightweight C++11 unit testing framework
- xUnit architecture with assertions and fixtures
- single static library, no external dependencies (except `pthread` under Linux)
- auto-registration of test suites and test cases
- measures execution times of all test cases and test suites
- integrated test runner with parallel execution of test suites
- multiple internationalized output formats: log, TAP, JavaScript and JSON
- easily integrated with custom test harnesses or results formatters in HTML
- neither relies on C++ exceptions nor RTTI
- intercepts uncaught C++ exceptions and runtime errors (floating-point
  exceptions, illegal instructions, divisions by zero, memory access violation,
  etc...)
- available on Linux and Windows for 32 and 64 bits architectures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick start
-----------

Download the
[latest release](https://github.com/neodesys/easytest/releases/latest) or clone
this repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/neodesys/easytest.git EasyTest++
$ cd EasyTest++
```

### Build the static library

```
$ make PLATFORM=linux ARCH=64 BUILD=release
$ make PLATFORM=linux ARCH=32 BUILD=release
$ make PLATFORM=mingw ARCH=64 BUILD=release
$ make PLATFORM=mingw ARCH=32 BUILD=release
```

### Build and run tests

```
$ make PLATFORM=linux ARCH=64 BUILD=release test && bin/Test_EasyTest++_linux64_release
$ make PLATFORM=linux ARCH=32 BUILD=release test && bin/Test_EasyTest++_linux32_release
$ make PLATFORM=mingw ARCH=64 BUILD=release test && bin/Test_EasyTest++_mingw64_release.exe
$ make PLATFORM=mingw ARCH=32 BUILD=release test && bin/Test_EasyTest++_mingw32_release.exe
```

### Generate source code documentation using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/)

```
$ make doc && xdg-open doc/generated/html/index.html
```

For detailed information about requirements, platforms and cross-building
please read the [*doc/Build.md*](/doc/Build.md) documentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
-----

**Note**: in all following commands, working directory is the parent directory
of EasyTest++ downloaded (and extracted) release package or, equally, the
parent directory of the source code repository with Linux 64 bits static
library built in release mode.

Host system is considered to be Linux 64 bits, please read
[*doc/Usage.md*](/doc/Usage.md) for other systems/architectures.

### Write a test suite

MyTestSuite.cpp

```cpp
#include <easyTest.h>

TEST_SUITE(MyTestSuite)
{
    TEST_CASE(addition);
    TEST_CASE(division);
};

TEST_IMPL(MyTestSuite, addition)
{
    ASSERT_EQUAL(1 + 1, 2);
    return true;
}

TEST_IMPL(MyTestSuite, division)
{
    ASSERT_ALMOST_EQUAL(1.0 / 3.0, 0.3333, 0.0001);
    TRACE("no issue with doubles");

    ASSERT_ALMOST_EQUAL(1.f / 3.f, 0.333f, 0.001f);
    TRACE("no issue with floats");

    return true;
}
```

### Build your test suite

If you have downloaded the release package:

```
$ g++ -std=c++11 -I./EasyTest++/include -o Test_MyTestSuite MyTestSuite.cpp -pthread -L./EasyTest++/lib -lEasyTest++_linux64
```

or if you have built EasyTest++ from sources:

```
$ g++ -std=c++11 -I./EasyTest++/include -o Test_MyTestSuite MyTestSuite.cpp -pthread -L./EasyTest++/bin -lEasyTest++_linux64_release
```

### Run your test suite

```
$ ./Test_MyTestSuite -sv
```

For detailed information about EasyTest++ advanced usage, test suites
documentation and runner options please read the [*doc/Usage.md*](/doc/Usage.md)
documentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues
------------

- Under Linux, if your glibc version is older than 2.17 you will have to link
  test runner executables with the `rt` library. If you encounter this error
  when linking `undefined reference to 'clock_gettime'`, it means that you have
  to add `-lrt` at the end of your link command.
  
  If you are building EasyTest++ test runner, replace `make` commands by
  `LDLIBS=-lrt make` or just `export LDLIBS=-lrt` once for all.
  
  If you are building your own test runner using EasyTest++ static library,
  just add `-lrt` at the end of your link command.

- Under Windows, process and thread timers have a really bad resolution
  (superior to tens of ms), so their values are not really meaningful for
  normal test cases which execute in a few nano or micro-seconds.

- If a test runner is running through a debugger while a runtime
  exception/signal occurs and is intercepted, the debugger will catch the
  exception first and the test runner will stop.
  
  Under Linux, you can bypass this behavior specifying `handle all nostop
  noprint pass` to gdb.
  
  Under Windows, you cannot bypass this behavior and the debugger will always
  stop on an uncaught runtime exception. This should not be a big issue as,
  normally, test runners are meant to be run outside of any debugger.
